            The Republic of Kazakhstan is the largest country in Central Asia and ranks ninth in the world by land area. The total area of the country is 2,724,902 square kilometers!

        <ul class="custom-list">
            <li>to the north and west with Russia (7,548.1 km — the longest land border in the world),</li>
            <li>to the east with China (1,782.8 km),</li>
            <li>to the south with Kyrgyzstan (1,241.6 km), Uzbekistan (2,351.4 km), and Turkmenistan (426 km).</li>

            Kazakhstan is the largest landlocked country in the world, yet it is bordered by the Caspian and Aral Seas. The country's nature is diverse: from vast steppes and deserts to scenic mountains, lakes, and canyons. Here, ancient caravan routes, the nomadic cultural heritage, and modern metropolises intersect. Kazakhstan is a land where East meets West, where tradition and innovation grow side by side.

            Administratively, Kazakhstan is divided into 17 regions and three cities of republican significance — Astana, Almaty, and Shymkent. Additionally, the city of Baikonur has a special status and is leased to Russia until 2050. The nearby Baikonur Cosmodrome is open to tourists. Kazakhstan is a unitary state with a presidential form of government. It defines itself as a democratic, secular, legal, and social state. The highest values are the individual, their life, rights, and freedoms. The President is Kassym-Jomart Kemelevich Tokayev. Executive power is carried out by the Government, which consists of ministries, agencies, and services. Legislative power belongs to the Parliament, which consists of the Senate and the Mazhilis.

            Astana is the modern capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan, located in the north of the country along the Ishim River. The city is known for its unique architecture, rapid development, and rich history. One of the main symbols of Astana is the “Baiterek” monument — a 97-meter tower symbolizing the country’s independence and the new millennium. From its observation deck, visitors can enjoy a panoramic view of the city with its tall buildings, wide avenues, and green parks. In 2017, the population of Astana exceeded one million, affirming its status as a major economic hub. The city's economy is based primarily on trade, transportation, communications, and construction. Astana is the heart of Kazakhstan, where tradition and innovation blend, and every corner captivates with its beauty.

            In June 2018, Shymkent was granted the status of a city of republican significance, becoming Kazakhstan’s third metropolis. Previously, it was the administrative center of the South Kazakhstan Region (now Turkistan Region). Today, Shymkent ranks third in population and first in area among the country's cities. It is one of the major industrial, commercial, and cultural centers of Kazakhstan.
        </p>

            Kazakhstan is a multi-ethnic country. Over 120 nationalities and ethnic groups live here in peace and harmony. Tolerance and mutual respect are essential parts of the national policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The country is secular and multi-confessional. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. The most widespread religions are Islam and Christianity. However, many other faiths are also present in Kazakhstan, making it a shining example of harmonious coexistence of cultures and traditions.

        Kazakhstan is a country rich in natural resources such as oil, gas, metals, and coal. The export of oil and petroleum products is one of the main sources of state budget revenue. Additionally, agriculture — especially wheat production and export — makes a significant contribution to the country’s foreign currency income.
    </p>
    <p>
        Favorable natural conditions also promote the development of livestock farming. Kazakhstan is traditionally known for raising sheep, horses, camels, and cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
        In recent years, tourism has become one of the key priorities for the country’s development. Improving infrastructure, transport logistics, and service industries are essential steps in turning Kazakhstan into a global tourist destination. The traditional Kazakh hospitality, always ready to welcome guests, makes any journey here truly unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, ancient culture and customs thrive alongside modern cities, blending Eastern Turkic spirit with Western modernity. Kazakhstan impresses with its beauty — from vast steppes and majestic mountains to deserts and picturesque lakes.
